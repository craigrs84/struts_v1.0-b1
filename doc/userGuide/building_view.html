In particular, Struts provides support for building         internationalized applications, as well as for interacting with input forms.         Several other topics related to the View components are briefly discussed.       </p>            </blockquote></td></tr></table><a name="i18n"></a><table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff" face="arial,helvetica,sanserif" size="+1"><strong>3.2 Internationalized Messages</strong></font></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>              <p>         A few years ago, application developers could count on having to support         only residents of their own country, who are used to only one (or sometimes         two) languages, and one way to represent numeric quantities like dates,         numbers, and monetary values.  However, the explosion of application         development based on web technologies, as well as the deployment of such         applications on the Internet and other broadly accessible networks, have         rendered national boundaries invisible in many cases.  This has translated         (if you will pardon the pun) into a need for applications to support         <i>internationalization</i> (often called &quot;i18n&quot; because 18 is the number of         letters in between the &quot;i&quot; and the &quot;n&quot;) and <i>localization</i>.       </p>                <p>         Struts builds upon the Java platform to provide assistance         for building internationalized and localized applications.  The key concepts         to become familiar with are:       </p>              <ul>         <li><b>Locale</b> - The fundamental Java class that supports             internationalization is <code>java.util.Locale</code>.  Each             <code>Locale</code> represents a particular choice of country and             language (plus an optional language variant), and also a set of             formatting assumptions for things like numbers and dates.         <li><b>ResourceBundle</b> - The <code>java.util.ResourceBundle</code> class             provides the fundmental tools for supporting messages in multiple             languages.  See the Javadocs for the <code>ResourceBundle</code> class,             and the information on Internationalization in the documentation bundle             for your JDK release, for more information.         <li><b>PropertyResourceBundle</b> - One of the standard implementations of             <code>ResourceBundle</code> allows you to define resources using the             same &quot;name=value&quot; syntax used to initialize properties files.  This is             very convenient for preparing resource bundles with messages that are             used in a web application, because these messages are generally text             oriented.         <li><b>MessageFormat</b> - The <code>java.text.MessageFormat</code> class             allows you to replace portions of a message string (in this case,             one retrieved from a resource bundle) with arguments specified at             run time.  This is useful in cases where you are creating a sentence,             but the words would appear in a different order in different languages.             The placeholder string <code>{0}</code> in the message is replaced by             the first runtime argument, <code>{1}</code> is replaced by the second             argument, and so on.         <li><b>MessageResources</b> - The Struts class             <code><a href="api/org/apache/struts/util/MessageResources.html">org.apache.struts.util.MessageResources</a></code> lets you treat             a set of resource bundles like a database, and allows you to request             a particular message string for a particular Locale (normally one             associated with the current user) instead of for the default Locale             the server itself is running in.       </ul>                <p>         For an internationalized application, follow the steps described in         the Internationalization document in the JDK documentation bundle for your         platform to create a properties file containing the messages for each         language.  An example will illustrate this further:       </p>                <p>         Assume that your source code is created in package         <code>com.mycompany.mypackage</code>, so it is stored in a directory         (relative to your source directory) named         <code>com/mycompany/mypackage</code>.  To create a resource bundle called         <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyResources</code>, you would create the         following files in the <code>com/mycompany/mypackage</code> directory:       </p>            <ul>         <li><b>MyResources.properties</b> - Contains the messages in the default             language for your server.  If your default language is English, you             might have an entry like this:             <code>prompt.hello=Hello</code>         <li><b>MyResources_xx.properties</b> - Contains the same messages in the             language whose ISO language code is &quot;xx&quot; (See the ResourceBundle             Javadoc page for a link to the current list).  For a French version             of the message shown above, you would have this entry:             <code>prompt.hello=Bonjour</code>             You can have resource bundle files for as many languages as you need.       </ul>                <p>         When you configue the controller servlet in the web application         deployment descriptor, one of the things you will need to define in         an initialization parameter is the base name of the resource bundle         for the application.  In the case described above, it would be         <code>com.mycompany.mypackage.MyResources</code>.        </p> <pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;action&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;application&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;com.mycompany.mypackage.MyResources&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;.../&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
</pre>             <p>         The important thing is for the resource bundle to be found on the          class path for your application. Another approach is to store          the <code>MyResources.properties</code> file in your application's          class folder. You can then simply specify &quot;myResources&quot; as the          application value.       </p>     </blockquote></td></tr></table><a name="form_beans"></a><table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff" face="arial,helvetica,sanserif" size="+1"><strong>3.3 Forms and FormBean Interactions</strong></font></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>            <p>         At one time or another, most web developers have built forms using         the standard capabilities of HTML, such as the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>         tag.  Users have come to expect interactive applications to have certain         behaviors, and one of these expectations relates to error handling -- if         the user makes an error, the application should allow them to fix just what         needs to be changed -- without having to re-enter any of the rest of the         information on the current page or form.       </p>                <p>         Fulfilling this expectation is tedious and cumbersome when coding with         standard HTML and JSP pages.  For example, an input element for a         <code>username</code> field might look like this (in JSP):        </p>        <pre>
&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot;
      value=&quot;&lt;%= loginBean.getUsername() %&gt;&quot;/&gt;
</pre>              <p>         which is difficult to type correctly, confuses HTML developers who are         not knowledgeable about programming concepts, and can cause problems with         HTML editors.  Instead, Struts provides a comprehensive facility for         building forms, based on the Custom Tag Library facility of JSP 1.1.         The case above would be rendered like this using Struts:       </p>  <pre>
&lt;html:text property=&quot;username&quot;/&gt;
</pre>        <p>          with no need to explicitly refer to the JavaBean from which the initial         value is retrieved.  That is handled automatically by the framework.       </p>       <p>         HTML forms are sometimes used to upload other files. Most browsers          support this through a &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; element, that generates          a file browse button, but it's up to the developer to handle the incoming         files. Struts handles these &quot;multipart&quot; forms in a way identical to          building normal forms. In the next section, we will cover using Struts to          create a simple login form, and also a simple mulitpart form.        </p>            <a name="forms"></a><table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff" face="arial,helvetica,sanserif" size="+1"><strong>3.3.1 Building Forms With Struts</strong></font></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>                  <p>           A complete example of a login form will illustrate how Struts           makes dealing with forms much less painful than using straight HTML           and standard JSP facilities.  Consider the following page (based on the           example application included with Struts) named <code>logon.jsp</code>:         </p>        <hr> <pre>

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/html:form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html:html&gt;
</pre> <hr>         <p>           The following items illustrate the key features of form handling in Struts,           based on this example:         </p>                  <ul>           <li>The <code>taglib</code> directive tells the JSP page compiler where to               find the <i>tag library descriptor</i> for the Struts tag library.  In               this case, we are using <code>bean</code> as the prefix that identifies               tags from the struts-bean library, and &quot;html&quot; as the prefix that identifies               tags from the struts-html library.  Any desired prefix can be used.           <li>This page uses several occurrences of the               message tag to look up internationalized               message strings from a <code>MessageResources</code> object containing               all the resources for this application.  For this page to work, the               following message keys must be defined in these resources:               <ul>                 <li><b>logon.title</b> - Title of the logon page                 <li><b>prompt.username</b> - A &quot;Username:&quot; prompt string                 <li><b>prompt.password</b> - A &quot;Password:&quot; prompt string                 <li><b>button.submit</b> - &quot;Submit&quot; for the button label                 <li><b>button.reset</b> - &quot;Reset&quot; for the button label               </ul>               When the user logs on, the application can store a <code>Locale</code>               object in the user's session.  This <code>Locale</code> will be used               to select messages in the appropriate language.  This makes it easy to               implement giving the user an option to switch languages -- simply change               the stored <code>Locale</code> object, and all messages are switched               automatically.           <li>The errors tag displays any error               messages that have been stored by a business logic component, or nothing               if no errors have been stored.  This tag will be described further               below.           <li>The form tag renders an HTML               <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element, based on the specified attributes.               It also associates all of the fields within this form with a session               scoped FormBean that is stored under the key <code>logonForm</code>.               This bean is used to provide initial values for all of the input               fields that have names matching the property names of the bean.               If an appropriate bean is not found, a new one will be created               automatically, using the specified Java class name.               <li>The form bean can also be specified in the Struts configuration file,                in which case the Name and Type can be omitted                here. See &quot;<a href="building_controller.html#config">The Action Mappings                Configuration File</a>&quot; for details.)                          <li>The text tag renders an HTML               <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element of type &quot;text&quot;.  In this case,               the number of character positions to occupy on the browser's screen               has been specified as well.  When this page is executed, the current               value of the <code>username</code> property of the corresponding bean               (that is, the value returned by <code>getUsername()</code>).           <li>The password tag is used similarly.               The difference is that the browser will echo asterisk characters,               instead of the input value, as the user types their password..           <li>The submit and               reset tags generate the corresponding               buttons at the bottom of the form.  The text labels for each button               are created using message tags,               as with the prompts, so that these values are internationalized.         </ul>                  <p>           Handling multipart forms is also easy.  Obviously when you create a multipart           form you're creating a form that has at least one input of type &quot;file&quot;.  The first step to           creating a multipart form is to utilize the struts-html taglib to create the presentation           page:         </p>  <hr>           <pre>
&lt;%@page language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
&lt;%@taglib uri=&quot;/WEB-INF/struts-html.tld&quot;
       prefix=&quot;html&quot;&gt;
&lt;html:form action=&quot;uploadAction.do&quot;&gt;
  Please Input Text:
  &lt;html:text property=&quot;myText&quot;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  Please Input The File You Wish to Upload:&lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;html:file property=&quot;myFile&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;html:submit /&gt;
&lt;/html:form&gt;
</pre> <hr>         <p>           The next step is to create your ActionForm bean:         </p>  <hr> <pre>
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import org.apache.struts.action.ActionForm;
import org.apache.struts.action.ActionMapping;

public class UploadForm extends ActionForm {
  protected String myText;
  protected FormFile myFile;
  public void setMyText(String text) {
    myText = text;
  }
  public String getMyText() {
    return myText;
  }
  public void setMyFile(FormFile file) {
    myFile = file;
  }
  public FormFile getMyFile() {
    return myFile;
  }
}

The <code>validate()</code> method           has the following options:         </p>                  <ul>           <li>Perform the appropriate validations and find no problems -- Return either               <code>null</code> or a zero-length ActionErrors instance, and the controller                servlet will proceed to call the <code>perform()</code> method of the                appropriate <code>Action</code> class.           <li>Perform the appropriate validations and find problems -- Return an ActionErrors               instance containing <code>ActionError</code>'s, which are classes that contain               the error message keys (into the application's               <code>MessageResources</code> bundle) that should be displayed. The               controller servlet will store this array as a request attribute suitable               for use by the <code>&lt;html:errors&gt;</code> tag, and will forward               control back to the input form (identified by the <code>inputForm</code>               property for this <code>ActionMapping</code>).         </ul>                    <p>           As mentioned earlier, this feature is entirely optional.  The default implementation           of the validate() method returns <code>null</code>, and the controller servlet           will assume that any required validation is done by the action class.         </p>         <p>           One common approach is to perform simple validations using the validate() method, and            also provide further &quot;business logic&quot; validation as part of your Action object.          </p>        </blockquote></td></tr></table>     </blockquote></td></tr></table><a name="other_presentations"></a><table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff" face="arial,helvetica,sanserif" size="+1"><strong>3.4 Other Presentation Techniques</strong></font></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>            <p>         Although the look and feel of your application can be completely constructed         based on the standard capabilities of JSP and the Struts custom tag library,         you should consider employing other techniques that will improve component         reuse, reduce maintenance efforts, and/or reduce errors.

The example application included with           Struts illustrates this principle by creating the following tags unique to           the implementation of this application:         </p>                  <ul>           <li><b>checkLogon</b> - Checks for the existence of a particular session               object, and forwards control to the logon page if it is missing.  This is               used to catch cases where a user has bookmarked a page in the middle of               your application and tries to bypass logging on, or if the user's session               has been timed out.           <li><b>linkSubscription</b> - Generates a hyperlink to a details page               for a Subscription, which passes the required primary key values as               request attributes.  This is used when listing the subscriptions associated               with a user, and providing links to edit or delete them.           <li><b>linkUser</b> - Generates a hyperlink to a details page               for a User, which passes the required primary key values as               request attributes.         </ul>                    <p>           The source code for these tags is in the <code>src/example</code> directory,           in package <code>org.apache.struts.example</code>, along with the other Java           classes that are used in this application.         </p>       </blockquote></td></tr></table>              <a name="includes"></a><table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff" face="arial,helvetica,sanserif" size="+1"><strong>3.4.2 Page Composition With Includes</strong></font></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>                  <p>           Creating the entire presentation of a page in one JSP file (with custom           tags and beans to access the required dynamic data) is a very common design           approach, and was employed in the example application included with Struts.           However, many applications require the display of multiple logically distinct           portions of your application together on a single page.</p>                    <p>           For example, a portal application might have some or all of the following           functional capabilities available on the portal's &quot;home&quot; page:         </p>                  <ul>           <li>Access to a search engine for this portal.           <li>One or more &quot;news feed&quot; displays, with the topics of interest customized               from the user's registration profile.           <li>Access to discussion topics related to this portal.           <li>A &quot;mail waiting&quot; indicator if your portal provides free email               accounts.         </ul>                    <p>           The development of the various segments of this site is easier if you           can divide up the work, and assign different developers to the different           segments.  Then, you can use the <i>include</i> capability of JavaServer Pages           technology to combine the results into a single result page, or use the include tag           provided with Struts.  There are three           types of <i>include</i> available, depending on when you want the combination           of output to occur:         </p>                    <ul>           <li>An <code>&lt;%@ include file=&quot;xxxxx&quot; %&gt;</code> directive can include a file that contains           java code or jsp tags. The code in the included file can even reference           variables declared earlier in the outer jsp page. The code is inlined into           the other jsp before it is compiled so it can definately contain more than           just HTML.           <li>The include <i>action</i> (<code>&lt;jsp:include page=&quot;xxxxx&quot;               flush=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;</code>) is processed at request time, and is handled               transparently by the server.  Among other things, that means you               can conditionally perform the include by nesting it within a tag               like <a href="../struts-logic.html#equals">equals</a> by using it's               parameter attribute.           <li>The <a href="../struts-bean.html#include">bean:include</a> tag takes either a              an argument &quot;forward&quot; representing a logical name mapped to the jsp to include,              or the &quot;id&quot; argument, which represents a page context String variable to print              out to the jsp page.         </ul>         <p>           Another approach to this would be to use the Struts Template Tag library. See the                    Developer's Guide for details.         </p>         </blockquote></td></tr></table>        <a name="image_rendering"></a><table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#023264"><font color="#ffffff" face="arial,helvetica,sanserif" size="+1"><strong>3.4.3 Image Rendering Components</strong></font></td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>                <p>           Some applications require dynamically generated images, like the price           charts on a stock reporting site.
